Building Apache CXF Fediz
=========================

Initial Setup
-------------

1) Install J2SE 6.0 SDK, which can be downloaded from 
   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html

2) Make sure that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the newly installed 
   JDK location, and that your PATH includes %JAVA_HOME%\bin (windows) or 
   $JAVA_HOME$/bin (unix).

3) Install Maven 2.2.1 or newer, which can be downloaded from 
   http://maven.apache.org/download.html. Make sure that your PATH includes 
   the MVN_HOME/bin directory. 


Building
--------

1) Change to the top level directory of Apache CXF Fediz source distribution.
2) Run
	$> mvn.
   This will compile Apache CXF Fediz and run all of the tests in the Apache CXF Fediz source
   distribution. Alternatively, you can run
         $> mvn -Pfastinstall.
   This will compile Apache CXF Fediz without running the tests and takes less
   time to build.
   Depending on the load of remote Maven repositories, you may have 
   to run "mvn" several times utill the required dependencies are 
   all located in your local maven repository. It usually takes some time for 
   maven to download required dependencies in the first build.


Source Directory structure
--------------------------

 + plugins               contains the sources of the federation plugin
      + core             the core module contains the majority of functionality which is Servlet container agnostic
      + tomcat           the tomcat module is the bridge of the core to the tomcat specific security engine

 + services              contains the sources of the Identity Provider
      + sts              the sts module contains the configured CXF STS which supports the usecases for Federation
      + idp              the idp module is the bridge of the STS to a WS-Trust/SOAP unaware browser

 + examples
      + simpleWebapp     this example shows how to protect a simple web application using the fediz plugin
      + wsclientWebapp   this example shows how a protected web application calls a web service protected by the STS
           + webapp      contains the web application
           + webservice  contains the web services implementation
